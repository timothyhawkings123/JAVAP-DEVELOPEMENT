# JAVAP-DEVELOPEMENT
### What is JAVAP Command?
The javap command disassembles one or more class files. Its output depends on the options used. If no options are used, javap prints out the package, protected, and public fields and methods of the classes passed to it.
Here we are creating a custom JAVAP class by using reflection API that can show us all the related information of the passed class.
